# Science of Habits

_what and how_

---

# How Do Habits Work?

_things we don't know we are doing_

---

# The Habit Loop

* four distinct steps:
  * cue
  * craving
  * response
  * reward

+ constant, instantaneous, and unavoidable
+ driven by the animal brain

---

# Atomic Habits

* the smallest piece of a behavior
* habits have a compounding incremental impact
  * positive (improvement, building)
  * negative (worsening, intensifying)
* the system is more powerful than the goal

---

# Outcomes &middot; Process &middot; Identity

* outcomes are results we strive for
* process is how we implement change
* identity is self-perception and worldview

* driven by **evidence** and **belief**
* habits and identity are **self-reinforcing**

---

# Laws of Behavior
_what make a strong habit (good or bad)_

---

# 1. Obvious (Cue)

* practiced habits are **automatic**
* cue triggers are most often **time and location**
* **environment** compounds thought when decision-making
* **context** can amplify or eliminate inclinations to act

* behavior change requires **awareness**

---

# 2. Attractive (Craving)

* we are constantly driven by stimuli
* **supernormal stimuli** exist outside our caveman brain behavior
* we **imitate group norms** of the close, the many, and the powerful

* motives are a **dopamine-driven** feedback loop
* response is to anticipation **not fulfillment**

---

# 3. Easy (Response)

* building habit requires **repetition** not time or improvement
* being **in motion** is not necessarily **progress**
* _the best is the enemy of the good_

* habits that require the **least effort win**
* one habit will very often **flow into the next**

---

# 4. Satisfying (Reward)

* _what is rewarded is repeated, what is punished is avoided_
* our brains **inconsistently** evaluate rewards across time
* our environment is built around **delayed returns**

* strong habits are **positive experiences**
* kind and amount of satisfaction can be inconsequential

---

# Tactics
_approaches for building or breaking_

---

# Invert the Laws

1. Cue: ~~obvious~~ **invisible**
1. Craving: ~~attractive~~ **unattractive**
1. Response: ~~easy~~ **difficult**
1. Reward: ~~satisfying~~ **unsatisfying**

# The Habit Scorecard

## Understand What You're Doing Unconsciously

* catalog **every** habit along your day
* rate them:
  * „Ä∞ neutral
  * ‚úî good
  * ‚ùå bad
* ratings are **subjective**

---

# Habit Stacking

## Combine and Order Habits to Work Together

* use one habit as a cue for another
  * _after I finish eating, I wash the dishes_
* move bad habits to be rewards
  * _after I submit my pull request, I can check Twitter_
* pair good habits with cravings
  * _after I start my coffee brew, I stretch while I wait_
* apply **the golden rule of replacement**
  * _when I want a chocolate bar, I will a carrot_

* don‚Äôt clean‚Ä¶ **reset**
* use object placement
  * set up cues for activities to be **obvious**
  * reduce friction to make actions **easy**
* eliminate the option for bad habits

# Discovery, Disruption, Rebuilding

‚û° ‚û° ‚§¥ ‚¨Ö ‚§µ ‚¨Ü

# Habits and the Self

## Finding the Right Habits

* what **"work" feels like fun** to me?

# Creating Routines

## imagine your ideal life...

* what do you do when...
  * you wake up?
  * you get home or stop working?
  * you are expecting guests?
* make your space **conducive** to those behaviors

---

# Disruption

_when things don't work or change_

---

# Creating Routines

## Coming Home

* put on music
* take off shoes
* maybe have a snack
* make something
* eat dinner
* (free time)
* reflect before bed and the next morning

---

# Creating Routines

## At Home

* record player is by the door
  * so is the shoe cupboard

* desk is set up for arts & crafts
  * (computer games require setup)

<!-- panic -->

---

# Rebuilding
_habits are a loop_

---

# Situation Invention

## Start with Cues

* new cues can be **fabricated** in the absence of the old
  * invent a commute
  * fake schedule / timing
* ritualize almost everything
  * intentionally place, remove, rearrange
* **cast logic aside** (within reason)

---

# Reflect, Readjust, Repeat

## Brain Exploit Loop

* be **reflective** ‚Äì learn as you go
* be **forgiving** ‚Äì nothing is a failure
* **don‚Äôt** compare ‚Äì you are unique
* use **rewards** ‚Äì enjoy the process
